# Adversarial imitation learning

This repository contains implementations of adversarial imitation learning algorithms like [GAIL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03476)
and [AIRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11248).
<!-- Some experimental configurations are discussed in [What Matters for Adversarial Imitation Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00672) -->

## Prerequisite

1. Install mujoco-py. Details can be found [mujoco-py](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py)
2. `pip install -e .`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Train expert policy or use our trained model
2. Train adversarial imitation learning algorithm
